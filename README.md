# Background

Personally, I am at my university for most of the year, so I do not have the ability to traverse around my house to see my dogs, and I tend to get homesick sometimes.


## Problem

	Humans are limited in how fast they can travel. It is not instant, nor do we have the financial means to travel all the time. We are also limited such that we cannot be in multiple places at the same time either.


## Objective/Solution



*   Build a wirelessly controlled robot from anywhere in the world
*   Install camera to get live video footage from robot
*   Control robot from a secure site
*   Robot travels on the ground


## Materials



*   Raspberry Pi 4 Model B : $35
*   Micro HDMI to HDMI cable : $0 (Already have)
*   16BG Micro SD card (x3) : $9.90
*   5V DC 3A power supply adapter with USB type C : $0 (Already have)

Total Cost: 35 + 0 + 9.90 + 0 = 44.90


# Mock Up

	TODO: Add picture of materials


# Technologies

	TODO: Write down each technology used or plan to use


# Solution/Description

	TODO: Write down each piece of the solution, i.e. break it down into smaller pieces


## Who will do what?

	I, Samuel Rodriguez, will be doing all of the work


## When will it be done?
